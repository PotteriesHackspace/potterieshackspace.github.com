**Membership Rules**

The membership rules and regulations differ from the the hackspace rules as all members are subject to certain rules and legal obligations.

  * Sorry, members cannot be under the age of 18, guests can but members must be responsible for their guests

**Membership Fees**

Potteries Hackspace is entirely funded by it's members and without you we wouldn't be able to make this happen.

Every month we need to pay bills, as well as raising funds for equipment and supplies. Our main source of income is membership fees.

We have a very simple policy for membership fees:

  * Members pay what they like for membership on a monthly basis.
  * If you are paying less than you are taking from the Hackspace you'll be politely asked to increase your monthly payments.

A subscription of £15 per month is recommended, a minimum of £5 per month is encouraged.
