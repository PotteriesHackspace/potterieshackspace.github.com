We&#8217;re the Potteries Hackspace community group. Our space is the the only community workshop in Staffordshire.

There are hackspaces all around the world and now there&#8217;s one in The Potteries.

A hackspace is a place for people with common interests, often in computers, technology, science or art, can meet, socialise and/or collaborate.

Our aim is to provide and maintain a shared community workspace and equipment in Stoke-on-Trent or surrounding areas in order for our members to further their skills and share our skills with the local community.
