**Getting Involved**

There are just a few things you need to know before you get started.

The best way to get involved is to become part of our community online and join the discussions on our mailing list. We&#8217;d love to get to know you, so the easiest way to get started is by introducing yourself to us on the [Potteries Hackspace groups mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/potteries-hackspace).

**Open Nights**

The best way to get started is to come on down for one of our open hack nights, every Tuesday or any of the other events you seen on our calendar.

If it&#8217;s your first time, don&#8217;t be shy, we&#8217;re a friendly bunch, simply come along, say hello and introduce yourself.

**Membership**

Members get some fantastic benefits, so if you&#8217;d like to become a member, simply [follow the instructions and fill out the form](/join/).

The Hackspace needs your support in order to keep going, so we do ask you to pledge what you can each month to help sustain it.
