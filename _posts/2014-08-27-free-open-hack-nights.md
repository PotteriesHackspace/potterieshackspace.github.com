Our free open hack nights are every Tuesday evening from 7PM onwards.

**The Hackspace is always FREE on Tuesday nights 7PM.**

<!--more-->Every Tuesday the Hackspace is open for you to drop in and get hacking.

Our open hack nights are open to anyone, non-members are welcomed guests.

Tuesday nights are the best time to come down, check out the space and have a chat about becoming a member.

There’s always a few of us working on various projects and having a chat.

You&#8217;re welcome to get on with your own project or see if you can help out with an existing one.

You can bring your own tools or you can use what we&#8217;ve got in our growing selection of shared tools.

Most projects are welcome in our space including robotics, electronics, programming, knitting, crafts, woodwork, bike repair and much more.

If you&#8217;ve already got a project going, bring it along and if you&#8217;ve got any safety concerns, simply get in touch before coming to the space to make sure it&#8217;s suitable.
