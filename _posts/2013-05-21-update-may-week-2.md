<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">This week was pizza night, but we were pretty distracted by all the action.</span>

[<img class="alignleft" alt="DSC_1516" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dsc_1516.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="200" />](/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dsc_1516.jpg)First off, DanW very kindly got stuck in with his PAT testing kit. First for the chop was my donated angle grinder, which was great because I actually needed to use it.

Thanks to DanW and his handy PAT checker and some sticky labels we&#8217;re now a little bit safer.

Paul, Si and Tom were all getting stuck in to getting Sarah&#8217;s 3D printer up and running, which isn&#8217;t far off now. Just a case of connecting the hot end and reconfiguring the firmware and we&#8217;re ready to go&#8230;

**What would you print? Let us know in the comments!**

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-253 alignleft" alt="DSC_1518" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dsc_1518.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dsc_1518.jpg 3872w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dsc_1518-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dsc_1518-1024x685.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dsc_1518.jpg)

Ben and Finn were getting stuck in with their robot project. It looks complicated! I&#8217;m glad they know what they are doing! ðŸ™‚

Let&#8217;s just hope the three laws of robotics are applied!

**Keep an eye out here as I&#8217;ll be posting it&#8217;s progress here.**

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-254 alignleft" alt="DSC_1519" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dsc_1519.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dsc_1519.jpg 3872w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dsc_1519-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dsc_1519-1024x685.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dsc_1519.jpg)

This looks technical. There&#8217;s a multimeter involved and everything.

Turns out it was a software issue. I think they needed to reverse the polarities.

**Everyone knows you alwaysÂ [reverse the polarities](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReversePolarity)&#8230;**

Thanks for fixing my angle grinder Dan.

This plug dates back to before british standards were actually a thing.

**Life saver, possibly literally.**

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-257 alignleft" alt="DSC_1522" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dsc_1522.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dsc_1522.jpg 3872w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dsc_1522-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dsc_1522-1024x685.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dsc_1522.jpg)

This angle grinder can now go into the log for approval as it passed the PAT check after the plug was swapped for a good one.

Dan managed to do about 30 items before running out of sticky labels.

I&#8217;d say it was a thankless job, only I do remember thanking him many times, but another one won&#8217;t go amiss, so thanks Dan!

Charlotte was practicing her cup song, she even wrote a little tutorial for it.

**Maybe we&#8217;ll have a few more tutorials heading our way soon&#8230;**

Sorry guys, no videos this week, maybe next.

Speaking of next week&#8230;

Will we get Sarah&#8217;s 3D printer actually printing? Will we get the Raspberry Pi connected to our 3D printer with a screen? Will more people turn up with interesting gadgets? Will there be videos!?

**Find out in next weeks post!**

PS. Sorry for no pizza photos, we scoffed it all down before I had thought to take any.
