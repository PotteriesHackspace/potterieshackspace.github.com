[Richard Smedley](https://twitter.com/richardsmedley) owned the potterieshackspace.org domain since around 2010, when the first meet up occurred.

Since then, Richard has had little direct involvement in the group, but always kept the domain registered and allowed us the exclusive use of it.

Unfortunately, in August we became aware that the domain name had been [hijacked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hijacking), and was unrecoverable.

So behold, we have a new domain: [potterieshackspace.org.uk](https://potterieshackspace.org.uk/), kindly supplied by [Phurix Web Hosting](https://phurix.co.uk/).

Thanks.
