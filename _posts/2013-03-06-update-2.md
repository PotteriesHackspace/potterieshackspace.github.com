Hi all,

We started off tonight where we left off on Saturday&#8230;

[<img class="alignleft" alt="DSC_0838" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0838.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="200" />](/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0838.jpg)I began setting up the printers Dave had dropped off on the computers. Sure only 2D printers, but essential for the space. Now we have a colour laser and black laser setup on the network. This means we can now get some simple documents, such as signs, notices, forms, flyers all printed off on-site using our own resources.

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-100 alignleft" alt="DSC_0839" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0839.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0839.jpg 3872w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0839-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0839-1024x685.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0839.jpg)Kate set to work doing the artwork for our entrance wall, which is now sporting the official &#8220;Potteries Hackspace&#8221; logo. A much more welcoming message than the arrow we had before, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll agree. Perhaps next we&#8217;ll put a &#8220;Do Not Be On Fire&#8221; graphic&#8230;

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-101 alignleft" alt="DSC_0840" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0840.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0840.jpg 3872w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0840-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0840-1024x685.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0840.jpg)Si go to work on the PSUs, converting them into desktop power supplies. Doing what he does best with a soldering iron. Once we&#8217;ve figured out a standard connector I&#8217;m sure this will be the first of a few to come! We&#8217;ll definitely need these as our breadboards and components turn up next week.

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-103 alignleft" alt="DSC_0859" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0859.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0859.jpg 3872w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0859-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0859-1024x685.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0859.jpg)Tom and DanW got hands on with an angle grinder, cutting the steel bars to length for the 3D printer. &#8220;It cuts like butter&#8221; says Tom after comparing it to cutting with a hacksaw which was blunted in the process. Just the hot end, extruder and electronics to go now. Hopefully we&#8217;ll have the stepper drivers sorted and we&#8217;ll actually see some motors moving next week.

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-104 alignleft" alt="DSC_0870" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0870.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0870.jpg 3872w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0870-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0870-1024x685.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0870.jpg)Before we left, we all hung around having a brew and a chat, discussing things from 3D printers, to wood burners, to space (the final frontier). The guys quite liked the idea of getting a vacuum former setup using an old hover and the idea of sourcing a wood turning lathe. However, the question of whether we&#8217;d need three-phase power came into play and also flood plans so we have an idea where to put it.

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-105 alignleft" alt="DSC_0881" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0881.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0881.jpg 3872w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0881-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0881-1024x685.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0881.jpg)Although we didn&#8217;t even get around to playing with the Raspberry Pi (again), Dave did bring a few neat little screens down, so I am hoping to have a play with those next time.

However we have really made some great progress in the space now, so watch this space!
