Welcome to our new website!

You&#8217;ll be delighted to know that we&#8217;ve launched our very own website.

With support from [BitFolk](http://bitfolk.com/?ref=phs) for the hosting we&#8217;re now serving this from our very own Virtual Private Server.

Inspired by the [South London Makerspace](http://southlondonmakerspace.org/), we too have used the accommodating &#8220;[Spacious](https://wordpress.org/themes/spacious)&#8221; theme as a starting point.

All of our previous blog posts from potterieshackspace.wordpress.com have been imported to the new site so you won&#8217;t miss out on anything.

There&#8217;s still plenty to do to get the site to where we want it to be, but I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll agree it&#8217;s a step in the right direction!
