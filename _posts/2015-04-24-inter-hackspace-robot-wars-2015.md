It&#8217;s been a while since Robot Wars have graced our screens (Final episode date: March 28, 2004) but the fascination has never died and Hackspaces across the country are proving that.

After some discussionÂ with the [UK hackspace community](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/uk-hackspaces/KsrCstjxqkI/MiYnkOplIXkJ), we&#8217;re proud to announce that we&#8217;ll be holding the UK&#8217;s first ever &#8216;Inter HackSpace Robot Wars&#8217;.

Very kindly being organised by James Davies, who&#8217;s versed in building these type of robots, a [&#8216;Inter HackSpace Robot Wars 2015&#8217; page has been setup on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/interhackspacerobotwars) where you check for updates and keep in touch.

If you&#8217;re interested in the event, please join the Facebook page and leave a message.

The Rules will be based on the [FRA (Fighting Robots Association) rules](http://www.fightingrobots.co.uk/content/23-rules-and-safety_1), however as this is our first event rules may be subject to change.

We&#8217;ll also keep you updated with any official updates as they are announced through our &#8220;[Robot Wars](/events/robot-wars/)&#8221; events page.
