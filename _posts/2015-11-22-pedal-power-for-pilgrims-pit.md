Pilgrims Pit contacted Potteries Hackspace looking for help to make a pedal-powered generator. Why do they want to generate electricity from pedal power? We will get to that, but first: who or what is or are Pilgrims Pit?

The &#8216;about&#8217; bit, in the [Pilgrims Pit Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/PilgrimsPit) says:

> A community art cafe, a space for creation collaboration production discussion and imagination. A mechanism for regeneration and direct public engagement. 

With support from [Art City](http://www.artcity.org.uk/), Pilgrims Pit got started at the end of October 2015, and their focus is on engaging folk in Stoke town and creating a drop-in hub type space at 114 Church Street&#8230;

They are working with donations, found materials, and volunteers, and are letting the project grow organically; they&#8217;re also working with video to document their goings on in local area, as found on [their YouTube channel](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCEfCIhgkReU76zpVoWk4EUw).

The name includes reference to the [Two Saints Way](http://twosaintsway.org.uk/) &#8211; a 92 mile pilgrimage route which has its halfway point at Stoke upon Trent. The name also includes the words grim, and pit, and the whole things is open to interpretation&#8230;

### Pedal power

So that&#8217;s them, where does the Potteries Hackspace come in? In general there seems to be some obvious overlap in our objectives, and there is on going scope for collaboration; in the first case is their motivation for contacting us:

The Pilgrims Pit needs its electrics completely re-doing, and to raise funds for the materials needed to do that they are planning putting on a battery powered gig.

they have approached Potteries Hackspace seeking knowledge and skill shares towards a pedal powered solution&#8230;
