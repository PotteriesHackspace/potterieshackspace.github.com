Hi all,

We've got a good bunch of people, a large (but often cold) space and a few projects in mind.

**We need your equipment!**

What we're lacking is the right tools and the right equipment to actually get things done.

Some of the guys have started putting together an [Equipment Wishlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArsYN2_qKizvdFVtcDRkS1RTWVZTV2Z5ZUNkYWlKT2c) spreadsheet of stuff we need to get, which looks a little like this:

**Equipment**

  * 3D Printer
  * Laser Cutter
  * CNC Machine
  * Vacuum Former
  * Woodworking Lathe
  * Metalworking Lathe
  * Soldering Stations
  * Pillar Drill
  * Bandsaw
  * Scroll saw
  * Chopsaw
  * Belt/Disc Sander
  * Oscilloscope
  * Multimeters
  * Bench Power Supply

**Tools**

  * Screwdrivers
  * Screwdriver Bits
  * Clippers
  * Tweezers
  * Goggles
  * Gloves
  * Craft Knives
  * Antistatic
  * Soldering Iron Holder
  * Lighting
  * Files
  * Drill bits
  * Tarpaulin
  * Storage Boxes

**Consumables**

  * Solder

  * Tape
  * Isoproponol Alcohol

  * Tip Cleaner
  * Glue
  * Paper
  * Pens
  * Screws/Rawlplugs/Nails

If you have or can acquire any of this stuff or know someone who can, we'd be eternally grateful!

We hope that by sharing what you have it will open up access to other tools you may need for your projects all under one roof.
