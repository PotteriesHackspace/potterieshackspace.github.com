We’ve been extremely fortunate to have our current space for as long as we have on the basis that we’ve had it.

Our stay in the space has been precarious for a while, and now unfortunately we have been asked to vacate the premises by the end of October.

As the development of Tesco in the building below nears completion, the landlords have turned their focus to the upper level where we are currently situated, and are looking to make the space available for new high yield tenants, able to pay rent far beyond our means, even if we did reach critical mass.

This shouldn’t come as a surprise to many due to our loose agreement we had with the landlord. However, this isn’t the end end, we’ve got an exciting time ahead to explore new opportunities. This is only the start.

As one door closes, another one opens&#8230;.

**The question is: Where next?** It’s not an easy question to answer.

We need everyone to pitch in so we can find a new space. There’s a number of options, but no sure thing.

A space contingency planning meeting will be held on **Monday 5th Oct 2015 at 7:30PM**, at the hackspace. This is short notice, which means we can take action sooner rather than later.

Our hackspace is run by the members for the members, so we hope that as many of you can attend as possible &#8211; it&#8217;s important that we work together on what&#8217;s next for our organisation.

**There will be FREE Pizza and Beer.**

Thanks,

James Wade
