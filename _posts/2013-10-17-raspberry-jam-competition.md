**Are you ready?**

Just a quick update to let you know that the competition is less than 2
  
weeks away (29th October).

The judges and prizes are now secured so now it&#8217;s just down to you.

We&#8217;ll be opening up this Saturday (19th) from around 10am until about
  
1pm which should give some extra time to make headway.

However, don&#8217;t worry, your project doesn&#8217;t need to be complete, it just
  
needs to be able to demonstrate how a Raspberry Pi can be used.

The winner will be decided on a points based system by independent
  
adjudicators.

The best projects will be demonstrated at the NULC Raspberry Jam on the
  
7th November.

**Good luck!**
