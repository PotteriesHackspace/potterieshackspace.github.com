Hi guys,

Our Open Hack Night on Tuesday was busy as always.

Unfortunately I left my camera behind, so I didn&#8217;t get any snaps.

Instead I asked the guys to give us a brief update of what they have been up to:

Ian said:

> This week I did some wiring for kitchen area.
  
> Next week I will be doing: More kitchen and door lock wiring; Build worktop extension; Help Mat wire his bathroom fan controller; Help Sam with his audio stuff; Talk to tom about what he wants to mount the wood turning lathe on. (wall
  
> bench or freestanding).

Tom said:

> Paul and myself carried on working on the RFID Door lock (with a little help from Dan), its coming along now!
> 
> Hoping to have it working next week.

Paul said:

> Tom, Dan & me tackled the software for the RFID door entry. I also discussed with Ian & James about the positioning of the door units for the RFID, power supply and wiring route.. We discussed the layout of the kitchen. I also talked to Matt about his psu for his fan controller. For next week I hope to find some metal project boxes to house the RFID units and try to sort out how to store backup data in the EEPROM of the arduino&#8230; Need also to check the homebrew out for fermentation.

Myself, I too was pretty busy:

> This Week: Brewing beer, Helped Ian wire up the kitchen area, painted the wall for the projector
  
> Next Week: Bottling beer, helping setup the kitchen area with Ian, setting up AV in meeting room with John

Archie and Matt were discussing meeting for a drink or a curry on Friday night, everyone agreed it was a good idea and we said we&#8217;d follow it up on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/potteries-hackspace).

Before everyone went, I also requested that everyone take a flyer and post it up where they could around the area on any notice boards. So if know of a place you can pop one of our flyers up, please do get in touch.

Update: I plan on visiting the &#8220;[Journeys, Pathways and Track Plans](https://www.facebook.com/events/1506725896233453/)&#8221; at Spoke Works tomorrow night.
