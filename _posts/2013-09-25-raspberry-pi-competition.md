> It will be great to see some cool ideas come together, and should help everyone in the group participate together.

> If you&#8217;re allergic to Raspberries, we will also be starting a line-following robot competition, with a face-off sometime around Christmas!

> Its the chance to build something cool, win prizes and earn the undying envy/admiration of your peers..

> As always, let us know what you think!
