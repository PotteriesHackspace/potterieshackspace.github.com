Hi all,

Throughout July we&#8217;ve had a lot of activity down at the hackspace, but a few of us have either been away or focusing all our efforts into our 3D printer.

This has left little time for taking photos and promotion.

However, I thought I&#8217;d just drop a post out there to say we&#8217;re moving forward and our 3D printer is now printing, we&#8217;re just in the &#8220;tweaking&#8221; stages we&#8217;d hoped to be at weeks ago.

Bring on August!
