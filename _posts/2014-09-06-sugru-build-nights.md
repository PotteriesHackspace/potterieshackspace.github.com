We&#8217;ve had a load of [Sugru](http://sugru.com/) land with us at the Hackspace.

If you&#8217;ve never heard of Sugru, it&#8217;s a self-setting rubber that can be formed by hand.

We&#8217;ve been tasked with coming up with great ways to use Sugru.

It&#8217;s a great opportunity for us to be involved in something like this, so we&#8217;re hosting Sugru Build Nights.

<!--more-->Throughout September, every Tuesday night will be a Sugru Build Night.

  * Tuesday 9th September 7PM onwards
  * Tuesday 16th September 7PM onwards
  * Tuesday 23rd September 7PM onwards
  * Tuesday 30th September 7PM onwards

There&#8217;s already been quite a buzz about this and I know a few our members have some great ideas.

If you have an idea of something to make then join us 7PM onwards on any Tuesday throughout September at the Hackspace.

The Sugru is provided for free, as long as you [document your design on Instructables.com](http://www.instructables.com/community/September-2014-Build-Night-with-Sugru/).

Every entry gets 3 months Instructables Pro membership, plus a chance of wining Autodesk Product Design Suite Ultimate, or a Nikon D5200 Digital SLR Camera.

Get your thinking caps on.

Also, the best idea submitted from our Hackspace will win a prize.
