Hi all,

I got carried away last week and completely forgot to take any photos&#8230;

  * Ian: Did some work on Jib’s bench. Help Mat drill and tap his wheel hub for electric bike. Investigated radio control receiver to servo interface for James II (Dr. to be)
  * Jib: I finished my table by putting a brace on its back legs. Can now attach it to a wall if needed. Learnt how to use a jig saw. Helped Sam with his electronics project and learnt more about bikes and welding.
  * Sam: it was actually the next day that i finished the circuit that was working on &#8211; props to Paul for helping me find and identify some of the parts
