Last week the [RAMPS (RepRap Arduino Mega Pololu Shield)](http://web.archive.org/web/20121119111249/http://reprap.org/wiki/RAMPS_1.3) 1.3 kit arrived and I was really keen to get the 3D printer up and running as soon as possible. So Saturday morning I took it upon myself to get started on the assembly. Everything was going well until I soldered something in the wrong place. It wasn&#8217;t until I cross reference with a photo that I realised my mistake. A bit disheartened, I downed tools and decided to call it a day. Still, it was good progress.

With a bit of flux and skill I was soon re-armed with a hot soldering iron and a reel of solder. Despite difficulties with the instructions from the RepRap wiki (which are inaccurate and unreachable again), completing the rest of the soldering was fairly straightforward, especially with Si in close proximity.

Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll bring the drill bit down next week.

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-170 alignleft" alt="DSC_1025" src="http://potterieshackspace.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dsc_1025.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="168" srcset="http://potterieshackspace.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dsc_1025.jpg 3840w, http://potterieshackspace.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dsc_1025-300x168.jpg 300w, http://potterieshackspace.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dsc_1025-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](http://potterieshackspace.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dsc_1025.jpg)Instead Tom decided to recruit Steve and DanR for the Arduino software. Unfortunately we ran out of time to get the software sorted, but we&#8217;re not far off now before it all comes together. Fingers crossed for next week. Time to start learning how to use [SketchUp](http://www.sketchup.com/). What are you going to print?
