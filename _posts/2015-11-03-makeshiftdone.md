First of all, thank you for everyone that was involved.

Make:Shift:Do 2015 is a festival celebrating digital innovation in craft. The event is an opportunity for everyone to try their hand at a new craft for the digital age.

Organised by the Crafts Council, in partnership with the V&A, The Royal Society of Arts and the Institute of Making at University College London, the programme will see ‘Make Spaces’ across the UK open their doors to the public for free workshops, events and activities.

The day was a resounding success with a great turnout from our members and lots of activity.

[Our event](/events/makeshiftdo/makeshiftdo-2015/) really did represent everything that you&#8217;d expect from a Make:Shift:Do event.

I can&#8217;t thank you all enough for making it a great day and really pulling out all the stops to make it happen.

Special thanks to Paul and Beryl for organising the food.

Potteries Hackspace was setup with lots of activity. We agreed to run an Open Doors Day with Robots, 3D Printers, Bikes, Raspberry Pis and Arduinos.

There was Sonic Pi action on a Raspberry Pi, and Alex&#8217;s e-ukulele in the AV room too!

Thank you.
