Hi all,

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-116 alignleft" alt="DSC_0885" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0885.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0885.jpg 3872w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0885-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0885-1024x685.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0885.jpg)To begin with weÂ weren&#8217;tÂ sure who was coming down, but it was a good turn out.

It&#8217;s great to see people helping each other with various projects, there&#8217;s a great sense of community building up from the group, which is fantastic. So thanks for everyone who came down. You guys really make it what it is.

Coffee, Milk and Sugar needed replenishing so now we&#8217;ve got enough for quite some time, so come down and have a brew with us! ðŸ™‚

Thanks to Kate who redid my &#8220;prototype&#8221;, we&#8217;ve now got our binary &#8220;Brew Board&#8221; setup so, if you&#8217;re getting a round in for your fellow hackers, you know their default choice without having to risk distracting them while holding a hot soldering iron or getting hands on with an angleÂ grinder.

Nobody wants more than one sugar though right?

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-127 alignleft" alt="DSC_0888" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0888.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0888.jpg 3872w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0888-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0888-1024x685.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0888.jpg)We&#8217;re building up quite a collection of small screens now. DanR took to task on them trying to figure out how to not only power them on, but get a video feed from a Raspberry Pi.

Not quite there yet, but hopefully we&#8217;ll have a Raspberry Pi demo setup in the next few sessions.

[<img class="alignleft" alt="DSC_0890" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0890.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="200" />](/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0890.jpg)Will brought down some Roomba robotÂ vacuumÂ cleaners. One which he intends to turn into some kind of Raspberry Pi powered death bot, or perhaps a roaming hackspace video streaming bot (we&#8217;re not sure yet) and perhaps even more oddly the other for actual vacuum cleaning&#8230; Who would have thought?

**[<img class="alignleft" alt="DSC_0894" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0894.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="200" />](/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0894.jpg)The electronic components arrived!**

Si brought down our order and got a home for them mounted on the wall.

Perhaps now we can actually start building some prototype boards and using our Arduinos.

[<img class="alignleft" alt="DSC_0897" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0897.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="200" />](/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0897.jpg)Having said that, a few guys were already getting stuck in with their own components and circuits which was great to see.

The hackspace is very quickly becoming a hive of activity, which is brilliant.

[<img class="alignleft" alt="DSC_0898" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0898.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="200" />](/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0898.jpg)Dave brought down his DIY vacuum former and some plastic to try, so we set to work heating up the plastic enough so it was tacky, then placing it over the Dyson powered vacuum bed hoping that it would take the shape of the moulds we had to hand.

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-136 alignleft" alt="DSC_0903" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0903.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0903.jpg 3872w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0903-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0903-1024x685.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0903.jpg)Unfortunately the puny Dyson wasn&#8217;t powerful enough and we&#8217;re not sure we got the plastic hot enough, yet weÂ persevered by getting a much larger, industrial sized vacuum and a heat gun to double up the heating process.

This seemed to work much better, so with a bit of tweaking we should have a fully functional &#8220;vacformer&#8221; kit ready to go.

However, unfortunately the Dyson has been relegated back to regularÂ vacuumÂ cleaning.

[<img class="alignleft" alt="DSC_0907" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0907.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="168" />](/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0907.jpg)AmongstÂ all the chaos, heroically Tom continued to work on the 3D printer, recruiting one or two of us now and again to be grips.Â By the end of the night the X/Y axis was actually looking like it was coming together nicely.

[<img class="alignleft" alt="DSC_0892" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0892.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="200" />](/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dsc_0892.jpg)

The hackspace is coming together nicely now, we all got a lot done last night. There was a great buzz.

For those of your interested, due to the success of the night we&#8217;ll be opening on Saturday from 10am, so if you struggle to make Tuesday nights now&#8217;s your chance to come down and say hello!

**See you on Saturday!**
