If you&#8217;re interested in doing strange things with electricity then you&#8217;ll be right at home at Potteries Hackspace as we&#8217;re planning to host dorkbot meetings for the area as part of our open night.

So what is [dorkbot](http://www.dorkbot.org/)?

<!--more-->

Dorkbot is a group of affiliated organisations worldwide that sponsor grassroots meetings of artists, engineers, designers, scientists, inventors, and anyone else working under the very broad umbrella of electronic art.

The dorkbot motto is &#8220;people doing strange things with electricity&#8221;.

Started by Douglas Repetto at the Columbia University Computer Music Center in 2000, dorkbot has spread around the world, with hundreds of chapters either planning or actively holding meetings.

The purpose of dorkbot meetings is to nurture a local electronic arts community and to encourage emerging, and established, artists to present new works for informal peer review. While many of the dorkbot groups hold their meetings at universities and students are encouraged to attend, dorkbot meetings are not restricted in any way to the academic community. Dorkbot groups encourage the free exchange of ideas on the electronic arts, and regular attendees of one dorkbot will often visit another when they are travelling, serving as informal ambassadors between groups.

We&#8217;re seeking people to host two or three presentations (about 20-30 minutes each) per meeting and sometimes very short &#8220;lightening&#8221; presentations from audience members.

You&#8217;ll find lots more information on [what a dorkbot meeting is all about](http://www.dorkbot.org/startadorkbot/) on the dorkbot website.

If you&#8217;d like to present at a dorkbot meeting, [pleaseÂ get in touch!](http://potterieshackspace.org/contact/)

Edit: Although we&#8217;re called &#8220;Potteries&#8221; and are currently operating out of Newcastle-under-Lyme, we&#8217;re really covering the entire of Staffordshire, so don&#8217;t be shy, everybody will be welcomed!
