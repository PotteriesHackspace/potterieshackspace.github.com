We have open meetings every Tuesday from 7PM.

You’ll find us in the old valeting bay of the former Randles car dealership in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire.

Whether you&#8217;ve got a project you want to stuck in with, or even if you haven’t, anyone is welcome to come down and have a brew.

It&#8217;s free to come along, there&#8217;s no obligation to donate but it is encouraged (usually £3).

Visit the [Potteries Hackspace website](http://www.potterieshackspace.org/) for more information.

See you there!
