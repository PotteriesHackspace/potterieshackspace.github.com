We've signed up to the ["Stoke-on-Trent Soapbox Derby"](https://www.facebook.com/events/859068430862950/).

It'll be on 4th June at 11am onwards at Hanley Park, Cleveland Road, Stoke-on-Trent, ST1 4DX.

We've come up with a name, a few designs and we have an idea for how it's all actually going to work.
