Following our Annual General Meeting and all the associated bureaucracy the hunt is on to find a new space.

We&#8217;ve been grateful for the space at the former Randles Garage in Newcastle-under-Lyme, but as we expected, due to redevelopment of the site, that option is now coming to an end.

We&#8217;re currently in talks with local authorities and large businesses in the area to explore more options.

We&#8217;ve got a few ideas of options being thrown around, including a space at a large business or space for a portacabin or container.

We will continue to meet on Tuesdays, working on our projects (such as the 3D printer), hacking apart unwanted donated hardware for recycling and general hackspace hackery.

More updates to follow&#8230;
