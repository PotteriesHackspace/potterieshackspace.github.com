Hi all,

Just a quick message to let you know that our Annual General Meeting is next week.

We're calling a general meeting.

<!--more-->

It's a bit later than expected in the year mainly due to Coronavirus preventing our regular meetups.

It's more important than ever because we have some exciting news that may affect the way we operate going forward and we'd like everyone's input.

The general meeting is only open to paying members only from the prior 12 month period.

We must follow the government guidelines for meeting so you will need to let us know if you can and will attend.

Sorry, this will not be like our regular open night, there will be no hacking.

* We're looking at [7.30PM on Tuesday 15th September](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NXJmMm50N2lrbjdodWVraWxvcWRzajByM3MgMDBuZnMxY3JsbDVxcmVob2s5OHFtbWl0bGNAZw&tmsrc=00nfs1crll5qrehok98qmmitlc%40group.calendar.google.com). If too many people can't make it, we will rearrange.
* We need at least 6 members for quorum, so please [fill out this form if you intend on attending](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNcjoiv0eDPcYixDGe6Q5EEuNrVKHfdnTTevO9AZGYGFPSjA/viewform).
* [Meeting Agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ErkYCM_5M0rvU5AFvLC1BAdUGyMRJ88aHslyj4rC5H0/edit)
* If you have anything you would like to be mentioned in the meeting, please email the chairman or reach out on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/potteries-hackspace/c/2_kVgbpjHDQ).

See you there!

Thanks.
