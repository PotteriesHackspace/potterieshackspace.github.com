**Last time at Potteries Hackspace&#8230;**

After the suspense I left last week I decided to go the whole hog and start with a recap, so if you cast your mind back a bit you&#8217;ll remember l**ast time&#8230;**

We were looking at connecting the Raspberry Pi to a touch screen monitor and well we&#8217;re one step closer. Everything is connected, it&#8217;s now a case of configuring the software. **3D printing&#8230; Soon.**

Dave and Will came down armed with their laptops and random bits of hardware, such as a roomba that Will was working on, with a front mounted camera.

**Eye spy with my little eye!**

The idea is that soon enough we&#8217;ll have a video streaming wireless robot roaming the hackspace that **you** can control. Pretty neat huh?

**Look busy everyone, I&#8217;m taking a photo&#8230; **Here&#8217;s the team busily working on the 3D printer and roomba robot respectively.

Here&#8217;s the end result. It sort of looks like a monster that found its way out of our storeroom at the moment, but before long we&#8217;ll be able to transform it into a proper piece of kit that looks the part too.

**Plus lots of masking tape&#8230;**

If you were paying attention, you&#8217;ll also see Jib&#8217;s bike in the background that John and he were working on.

**On yer bike!**

We&#8217;ve got videos this week of the Roomba in action.

**Next time at Potteries Hackspace&#8230;**

  * Dave&#8217;s coming down with the mission to fix Sarah&#8217;s printer. Will he turn up and get it done?
  * Will DanW turn up with the bits we need for our 3D printer?
  * Will I actually get this this Raspberry Pi connected to a screen!?
  * Will&#8217;s finishing his Roomba robot to go full wireless and become a hackspace scout with a full web based API so you can annoy the hell out of us. Will Will will his will power and not wilt?
  * Will I ever stop making bad jokes?
  * Will any more people turn up to check out what&#8217;s going down at Potteries Hackspace?!

Who knows&#8230; but find out next time here at the Potteries Hackspace blog&#8230;

See you tonight at 7PM!
