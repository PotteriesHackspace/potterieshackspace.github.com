Hi all,

Last week was a bit of an odd one.

I knew a few of our regular members were away including two of our core members Tom and Si. So with the weather as fantastic as it was, I made a decision to make the most of the weather following on from the the bank holiday and pass on.

This should be the exception, not the rule, and we&#8217;ll be back as normal again tomorrow night (Tuesday 14th May).
