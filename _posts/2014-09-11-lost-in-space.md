You&#8217;ll find Potteries Hackspace mentioned in this quarters &#8220;FactoryMag&#8221;, the online magazine for those working in the creative sector in Stoke-on-Trent and North Staffordshire.

<!--more-->

The article in the magazine entitled &#8220;Lost in Space?&#8221; features a section offering a selection of workspace types, we fall under the title of &#8220;makerlab&#8221;, described by the magazine as an &#8220;open access R&D lab for technical/digital types, offering easy access to equipment and materials&#8221;.

We&#8217;re mentioned as a local example of this.

We hope to have a larger involvement with FactoryMag and CreativeStoke in the future and see this as a very positive first step as our space goes from strength to strength.
