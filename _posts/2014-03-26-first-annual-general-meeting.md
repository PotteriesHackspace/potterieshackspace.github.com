Hi all,

It&#8217;s decided.

Tuesday 8th April 2014 will be our first Annual General Meeting (AGM).

It will be held opposite our normal meeting place at the Waggon and Horses pub from 7PM.

The Management Committee will need to be present. There needs to be at least 6 members to turn up to the meeting for the meeting to go ahead.

If you wish to have a say in the future of the group, it is important for you to attend this meeting.

See you there!
