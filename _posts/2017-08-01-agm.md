Hi all,

Just a quick message to let you know that our Annual General Meeting is upon us.

Sorry it's later than normal but we've been a bit busier than normal this year so the AGM ended up being delayed.

This will not be like our regular open night, there will be no hacking, instead, we'll be having Pizza and drinks.

<!--more-->

We need at least 6 members for quorum.

The meeting will follow the usual agenda...

* Welcome (Chairman)
* Apologies for absence (Secretary)
* Minutes of previous AGM (Secretary)
* Group activities report (Chairman)
* Financial report (Treasurer)
* Election of committee (Chairman)
* Any Other Business

If you have anything you would like to be mentioned in the meeting, please email the chairman or reach out on the mailing lists.

[Minutes of the meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ndzBYvnRiqivaXmYK4ZLNuDj74GY3sq7qcqB0_O8j14/edit) will be provided afterwards.

See you there!

Thanks.
