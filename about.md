There are [hackspaces all around the world](http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/List_of_Hacker_Spaces) and now there’s one in [The Potteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke-on-Trent_Built-up_Area) (Stoke-on-Trent Built-up Area).

A [hackspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) is a place for people with common interests, often in computers, technology, science, art, can meet, socialise and/or collaborate.

**Potteries Hackspace** formed in [2010](https://nwhackspace.wordpress.com/2010/05/05/a-hackspace-for-the-potteries/) as a group of technology enthusiasts, engineers and creative minds that started meeting on a regular basis in an effort to collaborate on various projects.

## Our aim
To provide and maintain a shared community workspace and equipment, to further our skills and share experience with the community around Stoke-on-Trent and the wider Potteries area.

## Our organisation
Potteries Hackspace is a membership [constitutional](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n_r_CWQdehnsC863m5AqWtzrILA6IF8CT7PReLStWqw/pub) organisation (SIC 94990) with charitable aims and as such is funded in most part by membership [subscriptions](/join).

### Our space
Members have 24/7 access to our space and we host public [events](/events) including weekly open evenings (Tuesdays, 7pm).

From computer networks to welding, electrical engineering to wood turning, and even a kitchen sink, we enjoy making things with the technologies available.

Whether you've got a project in mind, somethings you're getting stuck with, or even if you're just curious to see what's going on, all are welcome to come down and have a brew.

Safety is important to us, so when you visit please stay safe, especially around tools and equipment; follow guidance (such as do not be on fire), and any children are to bring one of their adults to be responsible for them.
