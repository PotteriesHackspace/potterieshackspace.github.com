There are [hackspaces all around the world](http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/List_of_Hacker_Spaces) and now there’s one in [The Potteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke-on-Trent_Built-up_Area) (Stoke-on-Trent Built-up Area).

A [hackspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) is a place for people with common interests, often in computers, technology, science, art, can meet, socialise and/or collaborate.

**Potteries Hackspace** formed in 2010 as a group of technology enthusiasts, engineers and creative minds that started meeting on a regular basis in an effort to collaborate on various projects.

Our aim is to provide and maintain a shared community workspace and equipment, to further our skills and share experience with the community around Stoke-on-Trent and the wider Potteries area.

Members have 24/7 access to our space and we host public [events](http://potterieshackspace.org/events/) including weekly open evenings (Tuesdays, 7pm).

From computer networks to welding, electrical engineering to wood turning, and even a kitchen sink, we enjoy making things with the technologies available.

Whether you&#8217;ve got a project in mind, somethings you&#8217;re getting stuck with, or even if you&#8217;re just curious to see what&#8217;s going on, all are welcome to come down and have a brew.

Safety is important to us, so when you visit please stay safe, especially around tools and equipment; follow guidance (such as do not be on fire), and any children are to bring one of their adults to be responsible for them.
