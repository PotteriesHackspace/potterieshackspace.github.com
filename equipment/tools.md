Tou can use what we’ve got in our growing selection of shared tools or you can bring your own.

It's our aim to open up access to other tools you may need for your projects all under one roof so by sharing what you have it will help us achieve this.

The tools we have include:

  * Screwdrivers
  * Screwdriver Bits
  * Clippers
  * Tweezers
  * Goggles
  * Gloves
  * Craft Knives
  * Soldering Irons
  * Files
  * Drill bits
  * Wood saws

If you have or can acquire any of this stuff or know someone who can, we'd be eternally grateful!

We hope that by sharing what you have it will open up access to other tools you may need for your projects all under one roof.
