## 2015

We hosted the first **Inter HackSpace Robot Wars** at the Potteries HackSpace, **Saturday 1 August 2015** &#8211; representatives from five UK hackspaces attended and were joined by a small audience for a day of robots-clashing, makers-chatting, food, drinks, and fun&#8230; More details and documentation on the [Inter HackSpace Robot Wars 2015 event page](/events/robot-wars/inter-hackspace-robot-wars-2015/).
