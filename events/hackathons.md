A hackathon (also known as a hack day, hackfest or codefest) is an event in which computer programmers and others involved in software development and hardware development, including graphic designers, interface designers and project managers, collaborate intensively on software projects.

We&#8217;ve so far taken part in [International Open Data Hackathon](http://opendataday.org/) and our own members-only hackathons.

If you&#8217;ve got an idea for a hackathon, we&#8217;d love to hear from you. Get in touch!
