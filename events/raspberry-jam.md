[Raspberry Jams](https://www.raspberrypi.org/jam/) are events organised by the community to share knowledge, learn new things, and meet other Pi enthusiasts. They’re a great way to find out more about the Raspberry Pi and what you can do with it, and to find like-minded people.

We&#8217;re actively involved in the [North Staffordshire Raspberry Jam](https://www.facebook.com/groups/northstaffs.rjam/) group, in association with Newcastle-under-Lyme College and Staffordshire University.

The North Staffordshire Raspberry Jam group is a place to gather to share ideas concerning the Raspberry Pi and associated technologies.
