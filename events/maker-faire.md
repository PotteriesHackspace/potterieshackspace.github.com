We&#8217;ve attended a number of Maker Faires both as individuals and as a group.

Maker Faire is the Greatest Show (and Tell) on Earth—a family-friendly showcase of invention, creativity and resourcefulness, and a celebration of the Maker movement. It’s a place where people show what they are making, and share what they are learning.

Maker Faire UK is a two day festival of hackers, crafters, coders, DIYers and garden shed inventors.

The Manchester Mini Maker Faire is part of the ‘imagine it, make it, move it,’ summer season of fabulous family events at MOSI.

Derby Maker Faire is held in the amazingly appropriate building Derby Silk Mill – the site of the World’s First Factory!

We hope to both attend and be part of as many Maker Faires as possible.
