# [Potteries Hackspace Website](http://potterieshackspace.org)

This is the source code for the Potteries Hackspace Website.

Originally we used a third party wiki as our homepage, however,
 the page was lost through no fault of our own.

So this was designed to be an easy to maintain, portable web page,
 which resulted in a single static HTML page.

## Features

The website has the following features:

* A static single page: fast, easy, portable
* Fixed subnav style navigation, including social network icons
* Large "hero unit" callout, featuring a photo background
* Section for rows of three projects
* Section for about, an embedded Google Document
* Section for who's involved, powered by jQuery and Gravatar
* Section for people to get in touch and a map of our location 

This website was produced thanks to these excellent "out of the box" solutions:

* [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://htm5boilerplate.com/)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/)
* [jQuery](http://jquery)
* [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com/)
* [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com/)
* [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/)

## Usage

We've made this open source so you can use it too!

If like us your group need your own webpage, don't rely on a third party wiki.

Instead, use this!

Simply, fork the project to your own organisation on GitHub and get started!
