# [Potteries Hackspace Website](http://potterieshackspace.org/)

This is the source code for the Potteries Hackspace website.

## Background

### 2010

Since around 2010, we used a [third party wiki as our homepage](http://www.hackspace.org.uk/wiki/Main_Page), 
 however, the page was lost through no fault of our own, so we decided to launch our own website.

### 2012

This was designed to be an easy to maintain, portable web page, which resulted in a single static HTML page.

### Features

The website has the following features:

* A static single page: fast, easy, portable
* Fixed subnav style navigation, including social network icons
* Large "hero unit" callout, featuring a photo background
* Section for rows of three projects
* Section for about, an embedded Google Document
* Section for people to get in touch and a map of our location 

This website was produced thanks to these excellent "out of the box" solutions:

* [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://htm5boilerplate.com/)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/)
* [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com/)
* [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/)

### 2013

We then creased a blog on Wordpress.com for the [Potteries Hackspace](https://potterieshackspace.wordpress.com/), but
 we soon hit limitations.

### 2014

Since, in 2014, we moved to a Wordpress powered blog, hosted on a Bitfolk VPS server. Here we created the
 [Hackspacious theme](https://github.com/PotteriesHackspace/hackspacious) for Hackspaces, a child of the Spacious theme.

# About

In 2016, we decided to move away from Wordpress, mainly due to the maintenance overhead.

Based on experience with [GitHub and Jekyll](http://wade.be/2016/01/30/welcome-to-jekyll.html) a decided was made to
 migrate our content away from Wordpress to Jekyll hosted on GitHub.

This has been made possible by the following:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/) for the hosting
* [disqus](http://disqus.com/admin/create/) for the comments hosting
* Ben Balter for the [WordPress to Jekyll Exporter plugin](https://github.com/benbalter/wordpress-to-jekyll-exporter)
* [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for the blog engine
* [jekyllthemes](http://jekyllthemes.org/) for helping us find a suitable theme
* [Pranav Raj S](https://github.com/pranavrajs) for his [Swift theme](http://pranavrajs.github.io/swift/)

Thanks.
